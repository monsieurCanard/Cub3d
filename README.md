## ðŸ“„ Description

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

Key features of the game implementation include:
- The management of the window 
- Display different wall textures
- Set the floor and ceiling colors to two different ones
- Handling point of view with W, A, S and D
- Parsing map file and handle issue with it

Additionally, the bonus part of the project requires the implementation of advanced features like :
- Wall collisions
- A minimap system
- Doors which can open and close
- Animated sprite
- Rotate the point of view with the mouse

## Installation and compilation commands :
```
git clone git@github.com:monsieurCanard/Cub3d.git

```
For the bonus part :
